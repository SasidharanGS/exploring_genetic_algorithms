1. Create a random population of N elemets 
2. A) Calculate fitness for N elements
    B) Reproduction / Selection
        1) Pick 2 parents (based on probability given by fitness score)
        2) Make a new element using:
            - Cross-over
            - Mutation

Cross-over:
- take half(usually) genetic information from each and combine the two

Mutation:
- used when there isnt enough variation in initial population to introduce artificial variation into the process
- represented as a percentage weight

Properties that must be present to make a successful genetic algorithm:
1. Heredity
2. Variation
3. Selection
